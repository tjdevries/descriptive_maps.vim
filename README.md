# descriptive_maps.vim
Do you sometimes forget your mappings? Fear not. Descriptive Maps is here.

## Usage

First run `:UpdateRemotePlugins`

For now, use the command:

```vim
:call DescriptiveStart()
```

And you can see all your mappings.

Soon, I'll add back the ability to view comments about them.

Sometimes, it executes correctly, other times it does not. :)
